# What is this
This is a practice repo to work through creating and using branches, making commits, and making pull requests.

# What do I do
Create a branch using `-b` in your terminal.
```
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
In that branch, experiment! Try some HTML and CSS changes, or add some buttons and some JavaScript. Nothing in your branch will affect the original code so do whatever sounds fun.

## Making some changes
In your branch, use `git add .` to add all of your changes at once and `git commit -m` to create a commit message. For this simple practice repo, `git add .` is fine; if you want to learn more, check out the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## Add your branch to the repository
In your terminal, after you've added and committed your changes, run `git push --set-upstream origin my-new-branch`. This will simultaneously create your branch in the online copy repository and add your changes to it.
